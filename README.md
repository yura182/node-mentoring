# Node.js mentoring

## Homework 1
### TASK 1.1
Write a program which reads a string from the standard input stdin, reverses it and then writes it to the standard output stdout.

The program should be started from npm script via nodemon(i.e. npm run task1).

The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the first-string processing.

### TASK 1.2

Write a program which should do the following:

Read the content of csv file from ./csv directory.

Use the csvtojson package (https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson) to convert csv file to json object.

Write the csv file content to a new txt file

Do not load all the content of the csv file into RAM via stream (read/write file content line by line).

In case of read/write errors, log them in the console.•The program should be started via npm script using nodemon(i.e. npm run task2).

### TASK 1.3
Rewrite the above-mentioned programs to use babel(https://babeljs.io/) and ES6modules.

### Run task scripts
`npm run task1`

`npm run task2`

`npm run task3-1`

`npm run task3-2`
